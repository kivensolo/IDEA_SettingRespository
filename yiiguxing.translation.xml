      <item value="Updates the state of the action. Default implementation does nothing. Override this method to provide the ability to dynamically change action's state and(or) presentation depending on the context (For example when your action state depends on the selection you can check for selection and change the state accordingly).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This method can be called frequently, and on UI thread. This means that this method is supposed to work really fast, no real work should be done at this phase. For example, checking selection in a tree or a list, is considered valid, but working with a file system or PSI (especially resolve) is not. If you cannot determine the state of the action fast enough, you should do it in the {@link actionPerformed(AnActionEvent)} method and notify the user that action cannot be executed if it's the case.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the action is added to a toolbar, its &quot;update&quot; can be called twice a second, but only if there was any user activity or a focus transfer. If your action's availability is changed in absence of any of these events, please call {@code ActivityTracker.getInstance().inc()} to notify action subsystem to update all toolbar actions when your subsystem's determines that its actions' visibility might be affected. @param e Carries information on the invocation place and data available" />
